# bookingdotcom
this is the setup from my end to make the booking.com clone exactly like the original site

I am using nodejs in back end and react in front end.
to host front end using NETIFY
to hose back end using RENDER
so I made 2 separate folder 1 for back-end (Server) and another for front-end (Client)
at first I used FIREBASE for database but it was difficult to store photos there
finally I am going to use MONGO DB ATLAS free tire to set the same goal
lets see what happens next ....
